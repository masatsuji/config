## React
-----------
- Never use default exports for components, use regular export
- When generating a new component (/ComponentA) create the following:
  1. ComponentA/index.js
    - index.js is a barrel file exporting component
  2. ComponentA/ComponentA.jsx
    - create a basic react comp w/ ONLY a <div className={styles.componentA}>ComponentA</div> in the return statement
  3. ComponentA/ComponentA.module.scss
    - create one componentA's top most class name
  - also update the barrel file (../index.js) one directory up if it exists

## Next.Js
-----------
- When generating a new route (ex. /routeA) do the following
  1. generate a routeA.module.scss file and add the routeA as a selector 
  2. generate a page.js file and import the routeA.module.scss file
  3. return a <main> element with className of routeA using css module
